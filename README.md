## Resources

## Summary 
The analysis of the congressional election starts with sorting the data and simplifying the information. 

1. First we found the total number of votes 
**Total Votes: 369,711**

2. Then the complete list of candidates that received votes 
**Candidate 1: Charles Casper Stockham**
**Candidate 2: Diana DeGette**
**Candidate 3: Raymon Anthony Doane**

3. By creating a variable for the votes per candidates and their respective (4.) percentage we found the election results by candidate 
**Candidate 1 received 23% of the votes (85,213 of the total)**
**Candidate 2 received 73.8% of the votes (272,892 of the total)**
**Candidate 3 received 3.1% of the votes (11,606 of the total)**

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote is:
**Diana DeGette**
**with 272,892 of the votes, 73.8% of total**
