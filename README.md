1. Calculate total number of votes.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.

## Summary 
The analysis of the congressional election starts with sorting the data and simplifying the information. 

1. First we found the total number of votes 
### Total Votes: 369,711 

2. Then the complete list of candidates that received votes 
### Candidate 1: Charles Casper Stockham
### Candidate 2: Diana DeGette
### Candidate 3: Raymon Anthony Doane

By creating a variable for the (3.) votes per candidates and their respective (4.) percentage we found the election results by candidate 
### Candidate 1 received 23% of the votes (85,213 of the total)
### Candidate 2 received 73.8% of the votes (272,892 of the total)
### Candidate 3 received 3.1% of the votes (11,606 of the total)

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote is:
# Diana DeGette
