# Election_Analysis
Module 3 - Python

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

- [x] 1. Calculate total number of votes.
- [x] 2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
- [x] 3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
- [x] 4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
- [x] 5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources 

- Data Source: [election_results.csv](https://github.com/GabrielaTuma/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/election_results.csv)
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.58.1

## Summary 
The analysis of the congressional election starts with sorting the data and simplifying the information. 

1. First we found the total number of votes:  
**369,711**

2. Then the complete list of candidates that received votes 

**Candidate 1: Charles Casper Stockham**

**Candidate 2: Diana DeGette**

**Candidate 3: Raymon Anthony Doane**


3. By creating a variable for the votes per candidates and their respective (4.) percentage we found the election results by candidate 

**Candidate 1 received 23% of the votes (85,213 of the total)**

**Candidate 2 received 73.8% of the votes (272,892 of the total)**

**Candidate 3 received 3.1% of the votes (11,606 of the total)**


5. The winner of the election based on popular vote is:
**Diana DeGette**
**with 272,892 of the votes, 73.8% of total**

## Challenge Overview

- [ ] 1. How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
- [ ] 2. Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- [ ] 3. Which county had the largest number of votes?
- [ ] 4 . Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- [ ] 5. Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Challenge Summary 

### Purpose 
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:
- Voter turnout for each county
- Percentage from each county of the total count
- County with the highest turnout

While trying to find the numbers per county something is very clear: **most of the code can be recycled** from the first assignment. 

![Different data can be analyzed with the same logial sequence if they have the same purpose - finding the variable 'x' with the biggest 'y' associated](analysis/Candidate vs County Analysis 2.png)
![Comparing codes for candidate and county analysis](analysis/Candidate vs County Analysis .png)

Even though we are analyzing different variables: candidate and county, our goal is the same, finding a 'winner' with the biggest amount of votes. The script can be used for any election by doing small adjustments to the code.
